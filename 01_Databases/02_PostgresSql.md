`API` is the acronym for `Application Programming Interface`, which is a software that allows two applications to talk to each other even if they are using different programming languages.

To explain this better, let us take an example.

Imagine you’re sitting at a table in a restaurant 🍽️ with a menu of choices to order from ≣. The kitchen in this case represents the `backend` that will prepare your order. What is missing is the link to communicate your order to the kitchen and deliver your food back to your table. That’s where the waiter 🦸‍♂️ or `API` comes in. The waiter is the messenger that takes your request or order and tells the kitchen – the `backend` – what to do. Then the waiter delivers the response back to you; in this case, it is the food.

A more real life example is using Twitter api in such way:

You: Hey Twitter 👋 I'd like all the tweets I've made in the last five days 🙏

The API then takes your request to Twitter's servers, ask it for the tweets and the server responds with:

```json
"tweets": [
    {
        "tweet":"So that's what an api is 🤔",
        "date": "1 day ago"
    },
    {
        "tweet":"Excited to start working on the backend 🤩",
        "date": "1 day ago"
    },
    {
        "tweet":"Check out my React project 😇",
        "date": "2 day ago"
    },
    {
        "tweet":"I'm about to finish React phase 😁",
        "date": "3 day ago"
    },
    {
        "tweet":"Hello World!",
        "date": "5 day ago"
    },
]
```

[]()
